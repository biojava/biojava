A few convenience classes to view protein structures with Jmol (if it is on the classpath),
to calculate a protein structure alignment and to investigate the internals of the protein structure alignment algorithm.

Possible start classes are BiojavaJmol, AlignmentGui.

Also MVC interface for structure-gui
