/**
 * Interface class to handle describing arbitrary features. A feature can be found at multiple locations in a sequence such as
 * the surface of a protein where different sequence positions make up that feature. Ligand binding pocket is another example.
 * The location in its current form knows the start and stop position in a sequence and thus should contain knowledge about the
 * actual sequence.
 *
 * A feature can contain features to handle cases where a domain is a feature and the secondary structures covered by that domain
 * and other requirements for grouping.
