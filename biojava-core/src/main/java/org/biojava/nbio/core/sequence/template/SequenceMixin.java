 * {@link Sequence}; or to any Sequence e.g. looking for the
 * {@link #getComposition(Sequence)} or {@link #getDistribution(Sequence)}
 * for any type of Sequence.

 * offered by the implementations of {@link Sequence} to provide all the

 * nothing about its backing stores (apart from calling out to it) this should
