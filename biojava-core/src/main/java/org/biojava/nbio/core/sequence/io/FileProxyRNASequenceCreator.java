/**
 * This class is a good example of using the SequenceCreatorInterface where during parsing of the stream
 * the sequence and the offset index are passed to create a Protein sequence that will be loaded in lazily.
 * This way you can load very large fasta files and store accession id and delay loading the sequence to save
 * memory. The index is the file stream offset so when a RNASequence has a call to getSequence() the
 * SequenceFileProxyLoader will open the file and offset to the index and retrieve the sequence.
 *
 * Same approach can be used for genome sequence data stored in a local fasta file, in a database or via http
 * interface to a remote server
