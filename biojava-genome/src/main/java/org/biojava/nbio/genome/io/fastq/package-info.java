/**
 * FASTQ and variants sequence format I/O.
 *
 * <p>
 * To read from an Illumina variant FASTQ sequence file:
 * <pre>
 * FastqReader reader = new IlluminaFastqReader();
 * for (Fastq fastq : reader.read(new File("illumina.fastq"))
 * {
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * To write to a Sanger variant FASTQ sequence file:
 * <pre>
 * Collection&lt;Fastq&gt; fastq = ...;
 * SangerFastqWriter writer = new SangerFastqWriter();
 * writer.write(new File("sanger.fastq"), fastq);
 * </pre>
 *
 * For further documentation on the FASTQ sequence format,
 * its variants, and how they are handled in O|B|F projects,
