/**
 * A term in another ontology.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is how you allow one ontology to refer to terms in another one. Since
 * these ontologies are designed to be modular and self-contained, it is
 * expected that you would not copy terms from one ontology into another. The
 * best-practice way to represent terms from another ontology in your one is to
 * use RemoteTerm instances. Ontology has a method importTerm that does this
 * for you. By default, imported terms will have names composed from the source
 * ontology and the imported term name. However, this should be over-rideable.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The imported term will have the same name as the original term. They are
 * implicitly identical to each other. The most common use of imports will be
 * to slurp in the "core" ontology so that operations such as <code>is-a</code>
 * and <code>has-a</code> are available.
 * </p>
