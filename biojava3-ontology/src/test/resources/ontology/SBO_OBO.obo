The assumption is that the binding of one modifier affects the binding of the second. Modifiers are assumed to bind at different sites.  The synergetic effects of the two modifiers depend on the parameter alpha (if unity then they are independent; if zero they compete for the same binding site). and reflect the effect of the presence of substrate and product on the binding of modifier A or modifier B. alphaA and  alphaB  factors account for the effect of substrate and product binding on the binding of modifier A and modifier B

def: "Enzyme catalysed reaction involving one substrate and one product. Unlike the reversible uni-uni mechanism (SBO:0000326), the mechanism assumes an enzyme intermediate. Therefore, the free enzyme generated after the release of product from enzyme-product complex is not the same form as that which bind the substrate to form enzyme-substrate complex. Some permeases are thought to follow this mechanism, such that isomerization in the membrane may be accomplished through re-orientation in the membrane.  <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <semantics definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000062\">\n      <lambda>\n        <bvar>\n          <ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000515\"> substrate\n          </ci>\n        </bvar>\n        <bvar>\n          <ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000512\"> product\n          </ci>\n        </bvar>\n        <bvar>\n          <ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000322\"> Kms\n          </ci>\n        </bvar>\n        <bvar>\n          <ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000323\"> Kmp\n          </ci>\n        </bvar>\n        <bvar>\n          <ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000422\"> Kii\n          </ci>\n        </bvar>\n        <bvar>\n          <ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000324\"> Vf\n          </ci>\n        </bvar>\n        <bvar>\n          <ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000281\"> Keq\n          </ci>\n        </bvar>\n        <apply>\n          <divide/>\n          <apply>\n            <times/>\n            <ci> Vf </ci>\n            <apply>\n              <minus/>\n              <ci> substrate </ci>\n              <apply>\n                <divide/>\n                <ci> product </ci>\n                <ci> Keq </ci>\n              </apply>\n            </apply>\n          </apply>\n          <apply>\n            <plus/>\n            <apply>\n              <times/>\n              <ci> substrate </ci>\n              <apply>\n                <plus/>\n                <cn> 1 </cn>\n                <apply>\n                  <divide/>\n                  <ci> product </ci>\n                  <ci> Kii </ci>\n                </apply>\n              </apply>\n            </apply>\n            <apply>\n              <times/>\n              <ci> Kms </ci>\n              <apply>\n                <plus/>\n                <cn> 1 </cn>\n                <apply>\n                  <divide/>\n                  <ci> product </ci>\n                  <ci> Kmp </ci>\n                </apply>\n              </apply>\n            </apply>\n          </apply>\n        </apply>\n      </lambda>\n    </semantics>\n  </math>" [src_code:NR]

Theta0 and Theta1 represent the minimal offset and maximal values of 'on' stage, respectively. Small values of Tw result in step-like changes. Phi is the time of the phase shift offset. In the case of light forcing, Tp represents 'light' period, Tc the cycle period, and Tw the 'twilight' timescale. Theta0 is the light value at the off state, and Theta1 the additional value at the on phase. <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n  <semantics definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000062\">\n    <lambda>\n      <bvar><ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000586\"> time </ci></bvar>\n      <bvar><ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000584\"> Theta0 </ci></bvar>\n      <bvar><ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000492\"> Theta1 </ci></bvar>\n      <bvar><ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000477\"> Phi </ci></bvar>\n      <bvar><ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000347\"> Tp </ci></bvar>\n      <bvar><ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000476\"> Tc </ci></bvar>\n      <bvar><ci definitionURL=\"http://biomodels.net/SBO/#SBO:0000347\"> Tw </ci></bvar>\n      <apply>\n        <plus/>\n        <ci> Theta0 </ci>\n        <apply>\n          <times/>\n          <cn> 0.5 </cn>\n          <ci> Theta1 </ci>\n          <apply>\n            <plus/>\n            <apply>\n              <minus/>\n              <apply>\n                <plus/>\n                <cn type=\"integer\"> 1 </cn>\n                <apply>\n                  <tanh/>\n                  <apply>\n                    <divide/>\n                    <apply>\n                      <minus/>\n                      <apply>\n                        <plus/>\n                        <ci> time </ci>\n                        <ci> Phi </ci>\n                      </apply>\n                      <apply>\n                        <times/>\n                        <ci> Tc </ci>\n                        <apply>\n                          <floor/>\n                          <apply>\n                            <divide/>\n                            <apply>\n                              <plus/>\n                              <ci> time </ci>\n                              <ci> Phi </ci>\n                            </apply>\n                            <ci> Tc </ci>\n                          </apply>\n                        </apply>\n                      </apply>\n                    </apply>\n                    <ci> Tw </ci>\n                  </apply>\n                </apply>\n              </apply>\n              <apply>\n                <plus/>\n                <cn type=\"integer\"> 1 </cn>\n                <apply>\n                  <tanh/>\n                  <apply>\n                    <divide/>\n                    <apply>\n                      <minus/>\n                      <apply>\n                        <minus/>\n                        <apply>\n                          <plus/>\n                          <ci> time </ci>\n                          <ci> Phi </ci>\n                        </apply>\n                        <apply>\n                          <times/>\n                          <ci> Tc </ci>\n                          <apply>\n                            <floor/>\n                            <apply>\n                              <divide/>\n                              <apply>\n                                <plus/>\n                                <ci> time </ci>\n                                <ci> Phi </ci>\n                              </apply>\n                              <ci> Tc </ci>\n                            </apply>\n                          </apply>\n                        </apply>\n                      </apply>\n                      <ci> Tp </ci>\n                    </apply>\n                    <ci> Tw </ci>\n                  </apply>\n                </apply>\n              </apply>\n            </apply>\n            <cn type=\"integer\"> 1 </cn>\n            <apply>\n              <tanh/>\n              <apply>\n                <divide/>\n                <apply>\n                  <minus/>\n                  <apply>\n                    <minus/>\n                    <apply>\n                      <plus/>\n                      <ci> time </ci>\n                      <ci> Phi </ci>\n                    </apply>\n                    <apply>\n                      <times/>\n                      <ci> Tc </ci>\n                      <apply>\n                        <floor/>\n                        <apply>\n                          <divide/>\n                          <apply>\n                            <plus/>\n                            <ci> time </ci>\n                            <ci> Phi </ci>\n                          </apply>\n                          <ci> Tc </ci>\n                        </apply>\n                      </apply>\n                    </apply>\n                  </apply>\n                  <ci> Tc </ci>\n                </apply>\n                <ci> Tw </ci>\n              </apply>\n            </apply>\n          </apply>\n        </apply>\n      </apply>\n    </lambda>\n  </semantics>\n</math>" [src_code:NR]
