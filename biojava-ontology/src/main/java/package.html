A general-purpose API for ontologies.
These are directed graphs consisting of <code>Term</code> obects.  Each
edge in the graph is annotated with a term which defines the relationship
between its subject and object terms.  In this API, these annotated
edges are called triples.
</P>
<P>Some interfaces and implementations from this package are extended in
{@link org.biojavax.ontology biojavax} to better facilitate their persistence to
biosql.</P>
