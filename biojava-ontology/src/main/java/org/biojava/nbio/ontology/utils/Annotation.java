/**
 * <p>
 * Arbitrary annotation associated with one or more objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Biological information often does not fit design patterns very well, and can
 * be a jumble of facts and relationships. Annotation objects provide a standard
 * way for you to store this mess as a property of an object.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Annotations may contain keys that have Annotations as values. In this way,
 * annotations can be shared among multiple Annotatable objects, and you can
 * represent semi-structured data.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is perfectly possible to wrap up almost any tree-like or flat data
 * structure as Annotation.
 * </p>
 * Other than when using the constructor, you should be able to
 * interact with nearly all Annotation implementations via this API.
