 * A BlockSet is a Data Structure to store aligned positions of a multiple alignment as a collection of {@link Block}s.

 * associated with it (RMSD, TMscore, background distances, etc.).
 * A collection of BlockSets, in a {@link MultipleAlignment}, allows the description of flexible multiple alignments.
 * Every BlockSet object is part of a {@link MultipleAlignment} instance, its parent.
