 * as required. If getScore() returns null, callers should recalculate the score
 * and then store it for future calls. Implementations can therefor reset the
 * cache if things change which might impact the scores.
 * 
 * A list of common scores are included to coordinate property names, but
 * additional scores can be stored as well.
