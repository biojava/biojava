/**
 * FASTQ and variants sequence format I/O.

 * To read from an Illumina variant FASTQ sequence file:

 * {
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To write to an Sanger variant FASTQ sequence file:
 * <pre>
 * Collection&lt;Fastq&gt; fastq = ...;
 * SangerFastqWriter writer = new SangerFastqWriter();
 * writer.write(new File("sanger.fastq"), fastq);
 * </pre>
