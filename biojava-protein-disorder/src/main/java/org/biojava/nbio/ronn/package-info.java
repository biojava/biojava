/**<p>
 * BioJava provide a module biojava-protein-disorder for prediction disordered regions
 * from a protein sequence. Biojava-protein-disorder module for now contains one method
 * for the prediction of disordered regions. This method is based on the Java 
 * implementation of RONN predictor. 
 * <p>
 * This code has been originally developed for use with <a href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jabaws">JABAWS</a>. 
 * We call this code JRONN. JRONN is based on the C implementation of RONN algorithm and uses the same model data, 
 * therefore gives the same predictions. JRONN based on <a href="http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/RONN">RONN</a> 
 * version 3.1 which is still current in time of writing (August 2011). 
 * Main motivation behind JRONN development was providing an implementation of RONN more 
 * suitable to use by the automated analysis pipelines and web services. 
 * Robert Esnouf has kindly allowed us to explore the RONN code and share the results with the community.
 * <p>
 * Original version of RONN is described in Yang,Z.R., Thomson,R., McMeil,P. and Esnouf,R.M. (2005)
 * RONN: the bio-basis function neural network technique applied to the detection of natively 
 * disordered regions in proteins. Bioinformatics 21: 3369-3376
 * <p>
 * Examples of use are provided below. For more information please refer to JronnExample testcases.
